## How to Use the Form

1. Fill in the required fields with appropriate details.
2. Each field has validation rules to ensure correct data input.
3. If any field is empty or contains invalid data, the **Register** button will be disabled.
4. Once all fields are valid and filled, the **Register** button becomes active.
5. After submission, we will get the Registration Successful message with submitted data.
6. You can click on **Register Another User** to submit another form entry.
